Name of the Project: Game of Cricket (Single player game with computer in opposition)

Objective of the System
The objective of this system is to provide entertainment to the user with very simple inputs but creating a massive level of competition in the user against the computer. The work of this system is simple, it works as a simple game of hand cricket but with even lesser effort for the user than the actual game. The actual physical game requires two players to play but this game can be played in a single player manner. The details of the system are given below.

Functions or Features of the System

-> The system lets the user pick batting or bowling side.
-> It provides the user as well as the computer with 12 balls to bat and bowl.
-> It also provides only two wickets to both the user and computer.
-> It gives proper instructions to the user so that they do not have a hard time figuring out what they are supposed to do.
Hardware and Software of the System

The software used for the system is Python IDLE 3.11 (64 bit). Inside the system the ‘random’ module built-in python was used for the computer to generate a random number between 1 and 6.

            cricket the user is willing to play like Test form, ODI form, T20 form etc.
